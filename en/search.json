    "text": "Preface\nWelcome to the “Uni-Saarland Survival Guide”!\nTo be honest, as a newly admitted student to Saarland University, while I am excited about the upcoming study abroad experience, I also feel nervous and anxious about the future. After all, challenges in studying abroad are endless, from the intricate procedures to the unfamiliar environment and the pressure of studying. Solving these problems requires a lot of information and preparation, but this information is scattered across various websites, posts, and even many experiences can only be passed on by word of mouth. It can be said that we urgently need a one-stop guide to help us cope with the upcoming challenges.\nFortunately, there have been some similar works, such as the Saarbrücken starter pack. This book is also inspired by these works. On this basis, I hope that the interactive e-book design of this book can make it more convenient for everyone to retrieve information.\nIn addition, this book is produced using the Quarto framework, with its source code hosted on GitHub and multilingual web versions built using Github Pages. If you have any suggestions about this book or want to contribute content (including translations), you can do so by submitting Issues and Pull Requests.\nIf you are a current student or alumni of Saarland University, and if you have any valuable experience and suggestions regarding studying, living, entertainment, etc.; or if you want to contribute translations of this book in more languages, please do not hesitate to contact me.\nHope to meet you in life at Saarland University!\nA new student at Saarland University who is nervously preparing luggage",
