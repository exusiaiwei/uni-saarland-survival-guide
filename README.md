## Background

Uni-Saarland Survival Guide is an open-source project initiated by students at Saarland University. We aim to create a comprehensive, reliable, and up-to-date guide for students to navigate their university life in SaarbrÃ¼cken. By leveraging the power of collective wisdom, we believe this guide can benefit both current and prospective students.
